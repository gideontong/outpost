# Outpost Journal: SDHacks 2019

SDHacks 2019 served as a perfect opportunity for us to work on Outpost and get some portions functional. We worked for approximately 16 hours throughout SDHacks on specific portions of the project that we thought were most important to finish first.

### Saturday - Sunday; October 26, 2019 - October 27, 2019

#### Summary

* Gideon worked on getting the hardware and related API's function.
* Brian worked on a prototype of the text messaging system for the web application.

#### Journal
Gideon worked on getting the API's for the hardware-based receivers and transmitters working and was able to get the transmitter to send packets to the receiver - as well as getting a basic UI running on the LoRa screens that displayed basic data (like signal strength and packets received). On the other side, Brian worked on the front-end and back-end of a basic web application for Outpost - prototyping a text messaging system that stores all messages in a mongoDB database.

In addition, on Sunday, October 26, we pitched our project to judges who expressed their enthusiasm for future applications of our long-range telecommunication project - such as in farming, gathering data, and staying connected to the digital world that connects us all.
